# SafeboxArduino
Using arduino to make a safebox with c++ code.

This code was created on the Tinkercad platform specifically for an Arduino.

Correct password to acess the safebox: 060914

Essentially, this code consists of a simulation of a password-protected safe.

The objective was to create code in which, if the user enters the wrong password three times, a red light will turn on and an alarm will sound. 
However, if the user enters the correct password, a green light will turn on and the door will open.
